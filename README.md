# EC601_MiniProject3

For the class project, our team has successfully built an android app using android studio. Therefore, I would like to investigate in REACT Native and to compare the differences between using REACT Native and anddroid studio for building android apps. 

##  REACT Native
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It can be used to develop applications for Android, iOS, and Web. It uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. Following the instruction on: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.

download NodeJS
the use of expo

# Comparison
* the Snack allows you to have a real-time visulization of your app
* it's easy to test on your phone (no need of wire, just download the expo app)
* the android studdio has activity and xml files seperated, REACT can write the function and style in the same file


The automated test was run using AWS test factory on the app.
